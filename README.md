# Colorful-Fortunes
python script that generates a random aphorism from a customizable list of aphorisms...and using lolcat and cowsay, gives it a little pah-zaz

For this to work properly, you need to first download cowsay and lolcat...
They should be easy packages to install using apt-get, brew, etc.

Enjoy!
